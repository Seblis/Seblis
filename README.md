- 👋 Hi, I’m @Seblis
- 👀 I’m interested in math, board games and web development. My long-term goal is becoming profficient in data science since I have solid math background. Due to my break I want to re-learn basics before I will dive deep into the more difficult stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, Bootstrap, jQuery and FastAPI (with Jinja2). I have Numpy, Pandas, .NET and React on the horizon.
- 💞️ I am pretty much looking forward towards some collabs, but I like to be really good at a technology before I work with someone using it. Regardless of that, if you want some help with Django/FastAPI projects or some intermediate algorithms/data structures in Python/Java/C++, feel free to reach out to me.
- 📫 If you have anything to tell me, please reach out to me using seblis91@gmail.com
